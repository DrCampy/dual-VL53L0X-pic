 This fully open-source sensor is a time-of-flight based distance sensor based on two VL53L0X from STMicroelectronics. It is aimed at providing accurate distance measurements at a high sampling rate which can go up to 50Hz. It is also largely configurable and offers an external interrupt functionality. It accepts a wide input voltage range and will adapt the \iic voltages to the input power.
